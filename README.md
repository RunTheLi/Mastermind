# Mastermind Game
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.

- By The Way
"I used ChatGPT to help wrote the code for this project because the Mastermind game is quite difficult for me to understand, and this project is quite complex for me."

- Reason why I'm using chatgpt for this project
"I did this because I want to understand the connection of the code and the functioning of the Mastermind game, mostly, also I'm still learning Ruby lang at this point"
